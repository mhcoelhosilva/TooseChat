# TooseChat

This is an experiment in making a basic chat application in C++ using Winsock. The goal is to learn a bit about networking and encryption along the way.

Here's the feature wishlist:

+ Basic command-line interface
+ Client-to-client messaging
+ Message encryption
+ Automated performance testing in Python

And a few stretch goals:

+ GUI using ImGui
+ Linux support
